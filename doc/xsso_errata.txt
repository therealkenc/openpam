Errata in XSSO, chapter 5:

p. 25:	the first member of struct pam_response is named "resp", not
	"response".

p. 28:	the first pam_sm_chauthtok() flag is PAM_PRELIM_CHECK, not
	PAM_CRED_PRELIM_CHECK.

Errata in XSSO, chapter 6:

p. 32:	"PAM_NEW_AUTHTOKEN_REQD" in the DESCRIPTION and RETURN VALUE
	sections should be "PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD".

p. 32:	pam_acct_mgmt() must be allowed to return PAM_AUTH_ERR.

p. 46:	"PAM_AUTHOK" and "PAM_OLDAUTHOK" in the DESCRIPTION section
	should be "PAM_AUTHTOK" and "PAM_OLDAUTHTOK", respectively.

p. 60:	"PAM_AUTHOK" and "PAM_OLDAUTHOK" in the DESCRIPTION section
	should be "PAM_AUTHTOK" and "PAM_OLDAUTHTOK", respectively.

p. 62:	the target_authtok_len argument to pam_set_mapped_authtok() is
	of type size_t, not a size_t *.

p. 52:	PAM_CONV_ERR is listed out of order and with the explanatory
	text "Conversation failure" instead of "Conversation error".
	It is listed correctly on the next page.

p. 59:	the last argument pam_set_data() should be written void
	(*cleanup)(...), not void *(cleanup)(...).

p. 66:	the first occurrence of "pam_acct_mgmt" in the NAME section
	should be "pam_sm_acct_mgmt".

p. 66:	pam_sm_acct_mgmt() must be allowed to return PAM_AUTH_ERR.

p. 70:	"pam_authenticate_secondary" in the SYNOPSIS section should be
	"pam_sm_authenticate_secondary".
	pam_sm_authenticate_secondary() takes argc and argv arguments
	like the rest of the pam_sm_*() functions.

p. 72:	the flags argument to pam_sm_chauthtok() is of type int, not
	const int.

p. 77:	the names of several arguments to pam_sm_get_mapped_authtok()
	are missing the initial "t" in "target".

p. 83:	the target_authtok_len argument to pam_sm_set_mapped_authtok()
	is of type size_t, not a size_t *.

p. 85:	the names of several arguments to pam_sm_set_mapped_username()
	are missing the initial "t" in "target".

p. 89:	the user argument to pam_start() is of type const char *.

p. 89:	the correct definition for struct pam_conv is as follows:

	struct pam_conv {
		int	(*conv)(int, struct pam_message **,
		    struct pam_response **, void *);
		void	*appdata_ptr;
	};

p. 90:	the correct definition for struct pam_response is as follows:

	struct pam_response {
		char	*resp;
		int	 resp_retcode;
	};

p. 90:	the last sentence of the DESCRIPTION section should refer to
	pam_set_data() rather than pam_set_item().
