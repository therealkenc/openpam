Before the next release:

 - Add oath_alloc_secure() which allocates memory using mmap() +
   mlock() and oath_free_secure() which wipes and frees it.

 - Rewrite openpam_ttyconv(3).
   - mostly done, needs review.

 - Fix try_first_pass / use_first_pass (pam_get_authtok() code &
   documentation are slightly incorrect, OpenPAM's pam_unix(8) is
   incorrect, all FreeBSD modules are broken)

 - Finish pam_oath(8) and oathkey(1).

 - Add loop detection to openpam_load_chain().
