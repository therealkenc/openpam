/**
 * The =oath_uri_decode function decodes a URI-encoded ("percent-encoded")
 * string.
 *
 * The =in parameter points to the string to be decoded, and the =ilen
 * parameter is its length.  If =ilen is 0, =oath_uri_decode will decode
 * the entire string.
 *
 * The =out parameter points to a buffer in which the decoded data is to
 * be stored; the =olen parameter is the size of that buffer.  If =out is
 * =NULL, the decoded data is discarded, but =oath_uri_decode still counts
 * the amount of space needed to store it.
 *
 * The output buffer is always NUL-terminated, regardless of how much or
 * how little data was decoded.
 *
 * RETURN VALUES
 *
 * The =oath_uri_decode funtion always returns the amount of space
 * required to store the entire decoded string, including the terminating
 * NUL.  This may exceed the actual size of the output buffer.
