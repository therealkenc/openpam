			  Installing OpenPAM
			  ==================

1. REQUIREMENTS

  See the release notes for a list of platforms OpenPAM has been
  tested on.

  You will need GNU Make and the GNU C compiler to build OpenPAM.  On
  some platforms, you may have to install these separately.

2. CONFIGURATION

  Use the "configure" shell script to configure OpenPAM for your
  system.  Options include:

    --with-modules-dir=DIR
	Indicates the directory where PAM modules will be installed.
	This option should not be used if you intend to install PAM
	modules in the system library directory.

    --with-pam-su
	Builds the sample PAM application.

    --with-pam-unix
	Builds the sample PAM module.

  A typical invocation might look like this:

  # ./configure --with-pam-su --with-pam-unix

3. COMPILATION

  To compile OpenPAM, simply run "make" in the top-level OpenPAM
  directory:

  # make

4. INSTALLATION

  To install OpenPAM, simply run "make install" in the top-level
  OpenPAM directory:

  # make install

$P4: //depot/projects/openpam/INSTALL#3 $
