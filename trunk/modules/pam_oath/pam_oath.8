.Sh NAME
.Nm pam_oath
.Nd OATH service module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service
.Ar module-type
.Ar control-flag
.Cm Nm
.Op Ar arguments
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
service module implements counter-based and time-based one-time
passwords.
.Pp
The
.Nm
service module recognizes the following options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm echo_pass"
.It Cm nokey = Ar fail | fake | ignore
Specifies how the module should behave when no key is available for
the user: either fail immediately, prompt for a code but fail anyway,
or let authentication proceed by other means.
\" .It Cm nouser = Ar fail | fake | ignore
\" Specifies how the module should behave when the user does not exist.
\" See
\" .Bm nokey
\" above.
\" .It Cm badkey = Ar fail | fake | ignore
\" Specifies how the module should behave when the user exists and has a
\" key, but the key could not be loaded (e.g. due to a syntax error in
\" the keyfile).
\" See
\" .Bm nokey
\" above.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
service module uses
.Xr pam_get_authtok 3
to prompt the user, and will therefore also be affected by the
standard options
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr oathkey 1 ,
.Xr pam.conf 5 ,
.Xr pam 8

The
.Nm
module and this manual page were developed by
